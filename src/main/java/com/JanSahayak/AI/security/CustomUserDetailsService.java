     * FIX 1: Added @Transactional so the Hibernate session stays open long enough
     * for Spring Security to call getAuthorities() on the returned User object.
     *
     * Without @Transactional, the session closed immediately after findByEmail()
     * returned. When Spring Security then called user.getAuthorities() → role.getName(),
     * Hibernate tried to initialize the lazy Role proxy — but there was no session.
     * Result: "could not initialize proxy - no Session" on every login attempt.
     *
     * FIX 2: Switched from findByEmail() to findByEmailWithRole() which uses
     * JOIN FETCH to load User + Role in a SINGLE SQL query. This is better than
     * relying on the transaction alone because:
     *   - No N+1: role is fetched in the same query, not in a second round-trip
     *   - No lazy-load surprise: role is always initialized when returned
     *   - Works correctly even if transaction boundaries shift in future refactors
     *
     * The findByEmailWithRole() query is already defined in UserRepo.java:
     *   @Query("SELECT u FROM User u JOIN FETCH u.role WHERE u.email = :email")
