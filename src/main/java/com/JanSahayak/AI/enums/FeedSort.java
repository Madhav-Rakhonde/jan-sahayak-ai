/**
 * FeedSort — the three sort modes available on the All, Location, and Following tabs.
 *
 * Applied via {@code ?sort=} query param on browse-tab endpoints.
 * Not used on the For You tab — HLIG ML owns ranking there.
 *
 * <pre>
 *   HOT  → sorted by viralityScore DESC, window = last 72 hours   [default]
 *   NEW  → sorted by createdAt DESC (pure chronological)
 *   TOP  → sorted by engagementScore DESC, all-time
 * </pre>
 *
 * Usage:
 * <pre>
 *   GET /api/v1/feed/all?sort=HOT
 *   GET /api/v1/feed/location?sort=NEW&lastPostId=123
 *   GET /api/v1/feed/following?sort=TOP
